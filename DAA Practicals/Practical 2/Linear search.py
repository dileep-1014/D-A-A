# 1. Read all elements into an array.
# 2. Read the element to be searched.
# 3. Start from the first element.
# 4. Compare each element with the search key.
# 5. If a match is found, print its index and stop.
# 6. If the end of the array is reached without finding the key, print “Element not found.”
